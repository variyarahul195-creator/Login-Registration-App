🚀Built a Login & Registration Web Application using Java!

Just shared a quick demo of my Login–Registration System developed using Java, JSP, Servlets, HTML, CSS, and deployed on Apache Tomcat inside Eclipse IDE.
 This project helped me understand the full workflow of backend authentication and server-side validation.
🛠️ Tech Used:
Java (Servlets, JSP)
HTML, CSS
Eclipse IDE
Apache Tomcat Server
Form Handling & Session Concepts

🔐 Project Features:
User Login & Registration functionality
Proper form validation (username/password)
Backend verification using Servlet
Error handling & dynamic messages through JSP
Clean UI with responsive design
Fully working end-to-end flow in a real server environment

🎯 What I Learned:
Request → Response cycle using Servlets
Authenticating user credentials on backend
Sending data between JSP ↔ Servlet
Handling POST requests securely
Structuring a Java web project inside Eclipse
Deploying and testing web apps on Tomcat
This project really improved my confidence in Java Web Development, and I’m excited to build even more complex applications ahead!

Would love your feedback 😊
